As of April 22, 2008, the EPA has cracked down on requiring the use of lead-safe practices. All contractor renovation, repair and painting work that disturb lead-based paint must be trained and certified in lead-based work. Failure to comply will lead to fines of $37,500 per day. EPA regulations stipulate that all personnel working on projects that might displace lead dust to be trained in an approved safe lead course. Those that are found in violation will be subject to a fine of $37,500 per day. For just a tiny fraction of that amount, you can ensure that you and your employees obtain full EPA certification. Drawing on our established track record of providing you with only the highest quality education, CleanEdison has crafted a Lead RRP course that is informative, responsible, and reasonably priced. Please check out our website and get in contact with us if you would like to find out more about our services and our continued devotion to safe and sustainable practices.

Whether it is about securing assets, advocating for new methods, or allocating resources to cover what are currently in use required a fast strategy. A good strategy of using resources means that higher e\u001fciency will be obtained. For instance, there are those who do argue that with less one can achieve greater results, and the option of using more resources in concentrated areas is wasteful as less results are achieved.\r\nExtending the argument further, strategy and resources in the 21st Century continue to be overlooked when justifying why and how big governments, corporations, and educational institutions choose to go big or small with what they already have. And in looking from all angles, the reality of the use of these resources intightly contested spaces means strategizing is most important during a period of uncertainties.\r\nTo contribute to the above academy theme, the Ambivium Institute is organizing a professional academy that will bring together qualify professionals to explore ways in which strategizing could mean using resources e\u001eectively. The academy will be organized around themes across many disciplines and engaging participants to insert what they know and learn from each eother in their areas of specialization; experiences which one can then be apply to his or her \u001feld of responsibilities. Global Strategy/Resources Management (GS/RM) is what we will study.","venueId":"1741311"}},
